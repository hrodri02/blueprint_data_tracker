Below is the npm version I am using and version of each package I am using.
npm version 10.1.0
http-server@14.1.1
dotenv-webpack@8.0.1

To run the application you can use the cmd below in the terminal after you have installed the packages.
npx http-server -p 8000

After you type the command you can view it on a brower by typing localhost:8000 in the address bar.

You will need the CLIENT_ID and API_KEY, so that it runs without errors. I will email those to you and you can add them to the constants in the gapi.js file.
